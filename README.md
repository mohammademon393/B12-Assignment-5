## 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll
1. getElementById(id): Selects a single element based on its unique id attribute. This method is specifically designed for ID-based selection, which should be unique within an HTML document.
2. getElementsByClassName(className): Selects multiple elements based on their class attribute. It returns all elements that possess the specified class name.
3. querySelector(selector): Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector. This method offers flexibility, allowing selection by ID (#id), class (.class), tag name (tag), or more complex CSS selector combinations. 
4. querySelectorAll(selector): Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector. Similar to querySelector, it provides broad selection capabilities using CSS selectors.
